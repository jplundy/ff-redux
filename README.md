# Fantasy Football Auction Value Model

[![CI](https://github.com/OWNER/ff-redux/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OWNER/ff-redux/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project provides a flexible framework for generating auction dollar values
for fantasy football leagues. It supports custom league configurations,
multiple data sources, and analytical techniques such as projections,
advanced stats, betting lines, and simulations.

The model uses a Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) foundation with
adjustments and calibration layers for realistic draft guidance.

## Project Structure

See `pyproject.toml` for tooling configuration and the `src/ffa` package for
implementation modules.
